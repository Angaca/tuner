# Tuner

​
(no musical knowledge needed for this!)
​
Musical notation (in the modern western world) is ordered like so:
`A`
`A#`
`B`
`C`
`C#`
`D`
`D#`
`E`
`F`
`F#`
`G`
`G#`

> after `G#` you would start back at `A`
> ​
> Guitars have 6 strings normally tuned to `E A D G B E`
> ​
> If you turned the first string (`E`) up by one it would go to `F`. Tuning up again would go to `F#` and so on!
> ​
> Your goal is to create a mini app that displays 6 musical notes that can be 'tuned' up and down individually. There should be an option to tune all notes up/down together.
> ​
> Use any technology you want!
> ​
> Bonus tasks:

- ability to 'save' and 'load' tunings
- add audio to hear the notes as you tune!
